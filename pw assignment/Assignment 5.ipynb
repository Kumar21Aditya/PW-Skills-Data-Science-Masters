    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class and an object are fundamental concepts that help organize and model real-world entities and their behaviors in software. Let's explain these concepts with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class:**\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have.\n",
    "- It acts as a prototype for objects, specifying the structure and behavior they should exhibit.\n",
    "- Class names are typically written in CamelCase for clarity and convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object:**\n",
    "- An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete representation of the class, with its own unique data and state.\n",
    "- Objects are created based on the class definition, and they can interact with each other and the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example of a `Person` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects (instances) of the Person class\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "person2 = Person(\"Bob\", 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing object attributes\n",
    "print(person1.name)  # Output: \"Alice\"\n",
    "print(person2.age)   # Output: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling object methods\n",
    "person1.greet()  # Output: \"Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\"\n",
    "person2.greet()  # Output: \"Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Person` is a class that defines the structure of a person, with attributes `name` and `age` and a method `greet()`.\n",
    "- `person1` and `person2` are objects (instances) of the `Person` class, each with its own data.\n",
    "- We can access the attributes and methods of each object, and each object behaves independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and objects are fundamental to OOP because they allow you to model and represent complex systems, break them down into manageable components, and create reusable code. This approach promotes code organization, modularity, and the ability to model real-world concepts in your programs."

    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    " Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It restricts access to certain parts of the object and prevents the direct modification of internal state. Encapsulation helps in data hiding and abstraction, promoting data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows a new class (the subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (the superclass or base class). It enables code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where subclasses inherit and extend the functionality of their parent classes. Inheritance fosters the \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions, making it possible to write more generic and reusable code. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and interfaces in some programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on their essential properties and behaviors while ignoring non-essential details. It provides a high-level view of an object or system and focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction allows developers to work with simplified, understandable models of objects\n",

    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "Ans:-The __init__() function, also known as the constructor method, is a special method in Python classes. It is automatically called when an object of the class is created. The primary purpose of the __init__() function is to initialize the attributes (properties) of the object with initial values. This allows you to set the object's initial state when it is created.\n",

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    In object-oriented programming (OOP), self is a convention used to refer to the instance of the class within the class itself. It is a reference to the current object, allowing you to access and manipulate the object's attributes and methods from within its own methods. The use of self is essential for maintaining the object's state and behavior and for distinguishing instance variables and methods from local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few key reasons why self is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Object Attributes: When you create an object from a class, self is used to access and modify the object's attributes (instance variables). For example, self.name refers to the name attribute of the current object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling Object Methods: Inside a class, you use self to call other methods of the same object. This allows methods to interact with and modify the object's state and behavior. For example, self.method_name() calls another method of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguishing Between Local and Instance Variables: When a method has local variables with the same name as instance variables, using self helps clarify that you are working with instance variables. For example, if there's a local variable name and an instance variable self.name, self.name explicitly refers to the object's attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Confusion: In a class, you may have multiple objects created from the same class blueprint. Using self ensures that each object refers to its own attributes and methods, avoiding confusion between objects."

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (the subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (the superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where subclasses inherit and extend the functionality of their parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of inheritance in OOP, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance**: In single inheritance, a subclass inherits from a single superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Animal:\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   dog = Dog()\n",
    "   print(dog.speak())  # Output: \"Woof!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance**: In multiple inheritance, a subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. Python supports multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class A:\n",
    "       def method_a(self):\n",
    "           return \"Method A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   class B:\n",
    "       def method_b(self):\n",
    "           return \"Method B\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   class C(A, B):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   c = C()\n",
    "   print(c.method_a())  # Output: \"Method A\"\n",
    "   print(c.method_b())  # Output: \"Method B\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: In multilevel inheritance, a subclass inherits from a superclass, and then another subclass inherits from the first subclass. This creates a chain of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Grandparent:\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           return \"Hello from Grandparent!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Parent(Grandparent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child(Parent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   child = Child()\n",
    "   print(child.speak())  # Output: \"Hello from Grandparent!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: In hierarchical inheritance, multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Shape:\n",
    "       def area(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "       def area(self):\n",
    "           return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "       def area(self):\n",
    "           return self.length * self.width\n",
    "\n",
    "   circle = Circle()\n",
    "   circle.radius = 5\n",
    "   print(circle.area())  # Output: 78.5\n",
    "\n",
    "   rectangle = Rectangle()\n",
    "   rectangle.length = 4\n",
    "   rectangle.width = 6\n",
    "   print(rectangle.area())  # Output: 24\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of different types of inheritance. It can involve multiple, multilevel, or hierarchical inheritance in a single class hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class A:\n",
    "       def method_a(self):\n",
    "           return \"Method A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   class B(A):\n",
    "       def method_b(self):\n",
    "           return \"Method B\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   class C(B):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class D(A):\n",
    "       def method_d(self):\n",
    "           return \"Method D\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   class E(C, D):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   e = E()\n",
    "   print(e.method_a())  # Output: \"Method A\"\n",
    "   print(e.method_b())  # Output: \"Method B\"\n",
    "   print(e.method_d())  # Output: \"Method D\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples demonstrate various types of inheritance in Python, illustrating how classes can inherit and extend the properties and behaviors of other classes. Inheritance is a powerful mechanism that promotes code reuse and allows for the creation of complex class hierarchies."
