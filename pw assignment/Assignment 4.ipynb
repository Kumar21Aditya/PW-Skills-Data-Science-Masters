    "Ans:-\n",
    "    To install Python on Windows and set the path variables, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version of Python for Windows. Choose the appropriate installer, either 32-bit or 64-bit, based on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the installer executable that you downloaded. Ensure you check the box that says \"Add Python X.Y to PATH\" during the installation, where \"X.Y\" represents the version number (e.g., Python 3.9). This will automatically set the necessary environment variables for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Follow the installation prompts, and Python will be installed on your Windows machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setting PATH Variables (Optional, in case it wasn't done during installation):**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you didn't select the option to add Python to your PATH during installation, you can do it manually by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Windows Start menu and search for \"Environment Variables\" or \"Edit the system environment variables\" and select it from the search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the \"System Properties\" window, click the \"Environment Variables\" button near the bottom right.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the \"Environment Variables\" window, under \"System variables,\" scroll down and find the \"Path\" variable. Select it and click the \"Edit\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window, click \"New\" and add the path to your Python installation directory. By default, Python is installed in the \"C:\\Users\\<Your Username>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\PythonX.Y\" directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Replace `<Your Username>` with your actual Windows username and \"X.Y\" with the Python version you installed (e.g., Python 3.9).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Click \"OK\" to close each of the open windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verifying the Installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify that Python has been installed correctly and the path variables have been set, open a Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell window and type the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should display the installed Python version, indicating that Python is accessible from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! You have successfully installed Python on Windows and set the path variables. You can now use Python for your development and scripting needs."

Unlike many other programming languages that use braces or other symbols to delimit code blocks, Python relies on consistent indentation to determine the beginning and end of blocks."
